// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an
// if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for
// shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else
// block.

//One Version
let alein_color = 'Green';

if(alein_color=='Green')
{
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
}

//Another Version
else{
    console.log("The player just earned 10 points");
    
}
