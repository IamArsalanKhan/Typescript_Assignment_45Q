// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
// independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your
// array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really
// like bananas!.
// Array of my Favourite Fruits
var favorite_Fruits = ["Mango", "Banana", "Apple"];
